​🧠 Membit Context Agent — V67 (Local Risk Engine)
​A dual-purpose submission for the Membit Half-Hackathon:
​✅ A stable, production-ready Discord bot (V67) using real-time Membit data.
​✅ A narrative build (V67) showing a clear architectural roadmap for full MCP integration.
​V67 demonstrates what can be built today, and proves we have a clear vision for what comes next.
​“Context isn't data — it's awareness. Membit gives AI its eyes.”
​
🚀 1. Introduction
​Membit Context Agent transforms real-time cluster data from the Membit API into actionable insights inside Discord.
​Unlike static AI bots, this agent uses:
​Real-time social signals (Membit Clusters & Posts)
​Gemini AI reasoning (for sentiment & summarization)
​A 100% Stable Local Risk Engine (for !risk and !hunt coloring)
​Clean, latency-safe processing (aiohttp)
​This combination equips AI with something it normally doesn’t have: Awareness of what is happening right now.

​✅ 2. Core Features (Stable & Fully Working)
​These are the 6 core features shipped in V67 and tested for reliability.
>​!hunt <keyword> — Real-Time Cluster Hunting
​Searches for up to 6 clusters using Membit’s Search API. Uses:
​Heuristic Engine (compute_color) for instant risk coloring (Red/Green/Blue).
​One optimized Gemini call for a stable 1-sentence AI summary.
>​!analyze <text> — AI Sentiment Analyzer
​Provides a short, reasoning-based sentiment analysis (Positive/Negative/Neutral) using Gemini AI.
>​!risk <text> — Local Risk Scanner (100% Stable)
​This is our local, heuristic (keyword-based) risk engine. It does NOT call the AI, meaning it's 100% stable and will never fail with Empty parts. It provides instant risk recommendations (High Risk / Opportunity / Neutral).
>​!whatis <term> — AI Dictionary
​Simple, fast definitions for Web3, tech, and AI terms using Gemini AI.
​>!trend <keyword> — Data-Driven Trend Scanner
​Pure Membit data analysis. Counts Positive/Risk indicators from the top 8 clusters.
​>!context — Hackathon Context Command
​A "hardcoded" stable command that explains the purpose of Membit’s real-time context and how it powers AI systems.

​🔮 3. V-Next Roadmap (Narrative Build)
​V67 includes 1 intentionally disabled "experimental" command.
It replies with a Roadmap Explanation to show the limitations encountered and the clear vision for V-Next.

>​!compare <a> vs <b> — MCP Cluster Comparator
​Goal: Use the official /v1/clusters/compare endpoint for native, data-driven comparisons (instead of AI guesses).
​Status: Paused. Our tests (V51) failed, indicating we need to read the documentation more closely for the correct parameters (e.g., topicA, topicB).

​Roadmap: Integrate the real Membit compare endpoint for superior results.

​(We also paused exploration of !hot and !dive (MCP) due to API/model limitations documented in our V1-V60 debug journey.)

​🧩 4. Architecture Overview
​Async-first: Uses aiohttp for non-blocking API calls.

​Optimized: One AI call per workflow (in !hunt) to avoid 429 rate limits.

​Robust: Strong sanitization filters (clean_text) and a Local Risk Engine (anti-Empty parts).

​Community-Ready: Full cooldown system to prevent spam..

​🔥 7. The "Grit Story"
​This entire V67 build—from the initial V1 debug hell (404s, 429s, Empty parts, Falsbachink typos) to the final V67 "Local Risk Engine"—was coded, tested, and debugged 100% on a mobile phone.

​“If you want one thing, you have to risk everything.”
