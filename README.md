# 🧠 Membit Intel Agent – Deep Hunt Bot

**Membit Intel Agent** is a Discord bot that performs real-time data hunts using **Membit’s MCP and API**, allowing users to fetch live data clusters and relevant posts directly from Discord.

## 🚀 Overview
This project was built for the **Membit Half-Hackathon**, with the goal of demonstrating how Membit’s real-time context data can be integrated into chat-based environments.

By using simple commands, anyone in the community can explore live data from Membit without leaving Discord.
